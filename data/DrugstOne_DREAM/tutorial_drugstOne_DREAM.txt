1. Basic settings:
    iid as PPI
    only reviewed proteins
    only approved drugs

2. Upload file
    choose idspace: symbol

3. Node detail view
    show properties 
    cellular components

4. First neighbors (+prune)
    selection tab -> select all nodes
    Analsysis -> Target identification -> 1st neighbors
    idspace chooser while waiting
    open finished task -> prune on spd value -> try some cutoffs -> final: 0.2
    explain result: NOX1/NOX4 not connected but NOX5 is
    => Reproduced results (exact result depends on iid version)

5. Cellular Component Layout + OmniPath directions
    enable for pruned network
    show specific components in detail tab -> external link
    show .svg export
    save as network view (rename)

---

6. Clustering
    choose all nodes
    Clustering -> Leiden -> max cluster size=10
    in results: delete NOX4 
    Table view: modularity
    multi-drag to move clusters -> select cluster with NOX5

7. Pathway Enrichment
    launch task with defaults
    task results: explain table view -> filter pathway size
    explain concept of 'overlapping' nodes
    check out external link

    visuaize pathway: wiki - NO cGMP PKG Mediated Neuroprotection
    explain the 3 groups
    overlay with directions from OmniPath + Layout (for context)

    Add nodes:
        select DLG4 + NOS3 (only in Pathway)
    
    Pathway: wiki - sildenafil Treatment
    -> add selected nodes (one was already part of it)

    in detail view: explain rank/score -> as support to add nodes
    use pruning tab for score visualization (also possible for spd)

    save results: add only network, selected nodes, overlap -> create view
    => refined cluster (could continue for other clusters)
    -> show view (rename)
    -> show (only approved) drugs

8. Logger
    check out steps we dipg_drug
    download for e.g. supplement for a paper
    
9. Add proteins
    add NOX4 -> Not interacting
